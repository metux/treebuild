TreeBuild
===========

This is a buildsystem that models the structure of a software package
instead of using rules to drive the build process. From this structure
treebuild derives the (maybe platform specific) build process all
on itself.

The idea behind is: let the coder tell how is packages is structured,
what it's made of, but never ever have him to care how the actually
build process go.


Install:

    * install metux-java library from http://repo.or.cz/w/metux-java.git
    * install unitool from http://repo.or.cz/w/unitool.git
    * eventually adapt pathes at the top of build.xml
    * run `ant` to compile and `ant install` to install

Setup:

    * Copy examples/config/* to some proper place and adapt them to your 
      needs (unitool.cf the config file for the called unitool commands,
      it's location is specified in treebuild.cf)
    * set the location of treebuild.cf in $TREEBUILD_CONFIG

Running:

    * take some project which has an treebuild.xml file, got to that
      directory and call the `treebuild` procelain script

Writing an treebuild.xml:

    * take examples/buildfile/treebuild.xml as example, put it to your
      project's source directory and adapt it to your needs - the 
      format should be quite obvious ;-)
